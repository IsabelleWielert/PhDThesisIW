#Analysis of Radial Motility for the Project: Colony Eversion 

The development of this program was motivated by the necessity to gain insight into the radial motility of bacteria inside a colony. The program is based on the Colony Motility Analysis program, and its purpose is to analyse fluorescently labelled gonococcal videos. The first step is to track the single cells inside the colony. This is performed with the Trackmate PlugIn of ImageJ, which involves adjusting the contrast and using the StackReg PlugIn to exclude global motion of the colony. The Trackmate PlugIn provides an excel-sheet of tracks for each bacterium (.csv data). Subsequently, an image of the colony (.tif) is read in RadialMSDwithouShells.m and the .csv file to determine the centre-of-mass of the colony, thus enabling the position of the bacterium to be determined as a function of radial depth. The program provides a list of the position of each bacterium and its diffusion constant, determined via the mean-squared displacment. Finally, a moving mean is applied via MovingMeanRadialshell.m to determine the diffusion constants inside the colony, dependent on the distance to the centre of the colony. By this, we also determine the size of the inner active shell.

To determine the mean-squared displacements of the inner bacteria in the centre of the colony, we used the program DetermineMSDforEversion.m.
