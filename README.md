This GutHub repository contains all the analysis programs that were utilised during my (Isabelle Wielert) PhD projects. The programs have been written in MATLAB 2019 and are organised according to their functionality.In each new branch, several programs that were employed for data analysis are included. A description is provided for every analysis. Additionally, instructions on how to process the data for analysis purposes are available. For image analysis, the bioformats_package.jar must be downloaded.


Here is a short overview about the branches: 
- ColonyMotilityandStructure (Analysis of single-cell tracks of bacteria embedded in colony. Determine the radial distribution function of gonococcal colonies - developed by Tom Cronenberg and adpated by Isabelle Wielert.)
- DoubleTrap (Analysis of Data from double laser trap & the calibration of the trap stiffness.)
- GrowthratesandStatisticalTest (Based on growth rate data from colony forming units.)
- PiliLabelling (Semi-automated programs to analyse videos of fluorescently labelled T4P - numbers and dynamics)
- RadialMotilityAnalysis_ProjectColonyEversion (Analysis of motility of fluorescentgonococci inside colonies, radially and time-resolved to investigate motility regimes.)
- StatisticalTest_SurvivalAssay (Statistical tests on data from survival assays of colony forming units to verify significant changes in killing kinetics)
- TwitchingMotility (Analyse the twithcing motility of gonococci. Developed by Lena Dewenter, post-processing of tracks was developed by Isabelle Wielert.)
