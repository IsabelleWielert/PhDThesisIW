# Statistical test on killing kinetics data 

The programme performs a combination of p-values and killing kinetics data, which must be stored as raw data in an Excel spreadsheet. The time should be recorded in columns, while the experimental repetitions should be documented in rows. In the event of testing multiple conditions, a new tab must be created in the Excel spreadsheet for each condition.
To obtain the p-values when comparing conditions, it is necessary to read the time points of the killing kinetics and the names of the conditions from the relevant tabs in the Excel spreadsheet.
