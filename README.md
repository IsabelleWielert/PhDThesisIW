This GutHub repository provides you with all analysis programs which were used during my (Isabelle Wielert) PhD projects. 

The programs are written in MATLAB 2019 and are sorted by their functionality. In every new branch you will find several programs which were used to analyse the data. For every analysis a description is attached. Furthermore, you can find information about how the data needs to be processed to be able to use them for analysing the data. 

Here is a short overview about the branches: 
- ColonyMotility (RawData from Fiji/ImageJ)
- ColonyStructure (developed by Tom Cronenberg and adpated by myself)
- DoubleTrap (Analysis of Data from double laser trap & calibration developed by myself)
- GrowthratesandStatisticalTest (based on data from colony formung units)
- PiliLabelling (Semi-automated program to analyse videos of fluorescently labelled T4P - numbers and dynamics)
- RadialMotilityAnalysis_ProjectColonyEversion (Analysis of colonies of fluorescent bacteria on the single cell level, radially and time-resolved)
- StatisticalTest_SurvivalAssay (statistical tests on data from colony forming units to resolve trends over time; based on DOI:10.21105/joss.06096)
- TwitchingMotility (developed by Lena Dewenter; Averaging samples developed by myself)
