This GutHub repository provides you with all analysis programs which were used and devekoped during my (Isabelle Wielert) PhD projects. 

The programs are written in MATLAB 2019 and are sorted by their functionality. In every new branch you will find several programs which were used to analyse the data. For every analysis a description is attached. Furthermore, you can find information about how the data needs to be processed to be able to use them for analysing the data. For image analysis, you need to download the package bioformats_package.jar to be able to perform the analysis.

Here is a short overview about the branches: 
- ColonyMotilityandStructure (Analysis of single-cell tracks of bacteria embedded in colony. Determine the radial distribution function of gonococcal colonies - developed by Tom Cronenberg and adpated by Isabelle Wielert.)
- DoubleTrap (Analysis of Data from double laser trap & the calibration of the trap stiffness.)
- GrowthratesandStatisticalTest (Based on growth rate data from colony forming units.)
- PiliLabelling (Semi-automated programs to analyse videos of fluorescently labelled T4P - numbers and dynamics)
- RadialMotilityAnalysis_ProjectColonyEversion (Analysis of motility of fluorescentgonococci inside colonies, radially and time-resolved to investigate motility regimes.)
- StatisticalTest_SurvivalAssay (Statistical tests on data from survival assays of colony forming units to verify significant changes in killing kinetics)
- TwitchingMotility (Analyse the twithcing motility of gonococci. Developed by Lena Dewenter, post-processing of tracks was developed by Isabelle Wielert.)
